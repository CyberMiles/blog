Finally! CyberWorld V2.0 will be launched in a few days. The CyberWorld engineering and product team has updated the operation staff on this great news, so we are here to announce it to CyberWorld supporters with all the excitement.

First of all, we’d like to thank all supporters for your patience waiting for such a long time after the launch of V1.0 several months ago. CyberWorld NFT marketplace will be worth the wait.

Now, let’s see the new features of CyberWorld V2.0. 

First and foremost, CyberWorld V2.0 updated CyberWorld's essential features, building a solid foundation for the further upgrade of V3.0. There is an amazing function that V2.0 migrates from the BSC to the CyberMiles blockchain, which significantly reduces the NFT minting and distribution cost **(to almost 'zero').** As a result, it's a great choice for artists to mint NFT on CyberWorld compared to other NFT marketplaces which are not only hard to use but also require tens or even hundreds of dollars gas fee and exorbitant commission. 

The second convenient function of V2.0 is that CyberWorld will be launched on the mobile app. CyberWold is embedded into CyberMiles App. Users can mint and buy NFT in the mobile app. Get the CyberMiles App in the App Store or click to [downloaded](https://www.cybermiles.io/zh-cn/blockchain-infrastructure/cybermiles-app/). 

Thirdly, V2.0 offers a very interesting and useful service, CyberWorld's new stable currency, called “Dimond(DO)”. DO will be launched both on the web version and the mobile. Moreover, DO can be bought and sold at an exchange rate of 1:1 with USDT. 

We want to emphasize again that V2.0 migrates from the BSC to the CyberMiles blockchain, which significantly reduces the NFT minting and distribution cost **(to almost 'zero').** As a result, it's a great choice for content creators to mint NFT on CyberWorld compared to other NFT marketplaces which are not only hard to use but also require tens or even hundreds of dollars gas fee and exorbitant commission. 

Today we share a surprise and simple message to the CyberWorld users and supporters. We will let you know as soon as the official launch happens at the end of Sept.
