## CyberMilesNFT Newsletter - NFT's 'Blue Ocean', the Global Market Capitalization of NFT is Near $18 Billion 


According to the report by CionGecko, **the global market capitalization of NFT is near $18 billion, trades $1.2 billion a single day. The number of transactions is over 710,000 pieces**. The number of users and trades is also rising. 

Nikhil Sethi, vice predict of a blockchain startup said," The global NFT market has exploded in 2021, with over $700 million entering the space.

We have now reached a volume of over $338.04 million, which is a clear sign of a revolution in the ecosystem." said Ritam Gupta, CEO and Co-founder of DeFi 11 (Gupta, 2021). 

In fact, the NFT market is still dominated by artworks. However, it is not difficult to find that the NFT use cases is constantly expanding in recent months. In addition to graphic art, we can also buy music, video, and more in the form of NFT. NFT gradually infiltrated the sectors of sports, music, and film. **NFT seems to achieve the vision where everything digital can can have ownership: to be bought and sold.** At the same time, NFT exchanges also prosper, such as CyberWorld and OpenSea. 

Seizing the advantage of NFT seems like a great opportunity for the creative sector. Artists who do not have their agents can interact directly with their audience. They can trade with the audience without galleries or platforms to sell their work. **NFT subverts the traditional way of artworks circulation, allowing the artwork to be sustainable.** The smart contract written in the artwork NFT defined with code that the artist can make money from the same work for more than once.
