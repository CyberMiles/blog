II. There are two ways to sell. Fixed price or auction (the highest price is given in the auction). If you sell at a fixed price, you need to enter the selling price in Diamond (DO), pegged 1:1 with the legal tender U.S. dollar.

Mainly used in the transaction of NFT on the CyberWorld marketplace, 1 Diamond  = 1 USD = 1 USDT). If it is an auction, you need to enter the starting amount and the closing time of the auction. Regardless of whether it is at a fixed price or an auction, if the sale is successful, the platform will charge 2.5% of the service fee, and the remaining 97.5% arrives at the seller's wallet address.
