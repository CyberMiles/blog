If you sell at a fixed price, you need to enter the selling price in Diamond, a stable coin issued by CyberWorld that pegs to legal tender U.S. dollar at 1:1 exchange rate. Mainly used in the transaction of NFTs on CyberWorld, 1 Diamond = 1 USDT = 1 USD; If you sell as an auction, you need to enter the starting prize and the closing time of the auction. Regardless of being at a fixed price or an auction, if the sale is successful, CyberWorld charges 2.5% as a service fee, and the remaining 97.5% goes to the Seller's wallet address automatically.
