### Background：

Thanks to Tokeninsight for its detailed report on the NFT market in Q2 and July. According to Tokeninsight 2021 Q2 & July NFT Industry Report,  we make a conclusion with the report about the hottest projects, developments, and latest data on the NFT market.

* CryptoPunks and Meebits tell us a trait of the popular NFTs: Rarity (the rarer your NFTs are,  the higher the secondary market sale prices).
* Larva Labs’ projects have the most successful FNFT avatars.
* The multiple-use cases enable Meebits to be valuable continuously, that is the Larva Labs’ metaverse identity (will grow in the future).

Ultimately the scarcity and the intrinsic value of ownership that NFT brings to the market depend heavily on the consensus of the community. In conclusion, NFT is expanding rapidly, but the overall quality is not ideal, and the audience is still small, especially in the games and collectibles sections. But the expanding trend is promising.

### Market Sum-up:

NFT market sales reached over $500m in Q2 2021. In the single month of July, 2021, the volume is 4.28x than Q4 2020. The average secondary market trading vol from Apr to July is $109m.

The surge of **GameFi** NFT is a confidence booster for the market.

* Axie Infinity started to lead the market in July, with new players growing rapidly.
* CryptoBlades’ SKILL is the best-performing GameFi token in July, along with the price skyrocketing from $0.9 to over $100.
* High-performance public blockchain and layer2 become the main choices for GameFi projects.

The largest decentralized NFT marketplace OpenSea got a record-high trading volume of $326m in July, increasing 118% comparing with June ($150m).

Rising NFT auction marketplaces like TopBidder create new rules, like radical action market, for collectors to play. The new NFT platforms: 
Ops: Users need to create their own NFT social business cards before they can create and socialize on the platform, each post will generate an NFT. Users can set the price of their business cards. The two platform charges a 5% commission on all transactions); 
TopBidder: Radical auction agreement based on the ERC721 standard. Every rNFT has a self-pricing mechanism with a bonding curve model.) 

In conclusion, the audience of NFT market is still small, the popularity of several popular NFTs has abated a little. However, for many they are still optimistic about NFT and continues to explore and invest. At present, it is suggested to follow closely with the regulation of NFT market and the improvement of NFT quality. We believe that the NFT market will be more popular led by Game NFTs and Collectible NFTs. The market is growing mature and accepting the concept of digital collectibles.
