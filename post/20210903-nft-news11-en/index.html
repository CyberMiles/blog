<h2 id="advantages-of-cyberworld">Advantages of CyberWorld:</h2>
<p>CyberWorld is the perfect marketplace for artists.</p>
<p>Firstly, CyberWorld values the creation of artists and encourages creativity. Our goal is to provide artists with a platform to connect with and maintain their supporters. Also, it can be a tool for creators to make a living. They can publish NFT by themselves without relying on third-party intermediaries such as traditional art galleries. And NFTs can be created in the digital world. As a result, NFT will be a more sustainable and predictable form of business.</p>
<p>Secondly, the engineering team has a strong background in blockchain. The team has been engaged in blockchain, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and art for many years and has rich experience.  The smart contract and NFT code have been certified by Certik to ensure the security of the code and protect the interests of every participant.</p>
<p>Thirdly, answering the needs of users, the marketplace is being optimized over time. For example, CyberWorld migrated from BSC to CyberMiles, addressing users’ concern over high trading costs, as well as TPS limitations. To make it even more user-friendly, anyone with an email address can receive NFT airdrops, and detailed text and video tutorials will be provided. CyberWorld will soon allow users to purchase with their credit cards.</p>
<p>Lastly, CyberWorld's upcoming V2.0 and V3.0 releases will be developed from an artist's perspective and needs. We're researching on Patreon, Instagram, and Reddit to address the concerns of artists. CyberWorld boasts great media and NFT/ crypto field resources, with different channels covering millions of followers (350,000 followers on CyberMiles&rsquo; Twitter alone).</p>
