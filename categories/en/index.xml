      <description>We can categorize the NFTs into Art NFT, FI NFT, IP NFT and Game NFT.
According to the research team at CyberMiles, many problems are identified with the current NFT market. All of them are to some extent preventing NFT from being enjoyed by more users, and may cause losses and risks to users who join the craze blindly. The following is derived from CyberMile&amp;rsquo; research.
¬†ART NFT has not yet developed a stable market preference and is highly susceptible to manipulation by pumping sharks; and the individual token prices are often overvalued and not for ordinary users to participate.</description>
