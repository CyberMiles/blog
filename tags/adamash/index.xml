      <description>CyberWorld is excited to have been working with the designer company ‘ADAMASH LAB’ to launch their first NFTs. ADAMASH LAB is an art-sharing platform for fashion artists and art lovers, built by designer ASH and his team. The concept of ADAMASH LAB was founded as a spiritual cave for &amp;ldquo;grow-ups&amp;rdquo; to let free of their nature and imagination. ADAMASH LAB will gradually launch the artworks of ADAMASH&#39;s series in the future, as well as artworks jointly released by prominent designers and brands.</description>
